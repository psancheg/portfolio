Computer Science degree, University Carlos III de Madrid 2016
### Work Experience 
Research engineer (02-2018 05-2024) focused on the research and implementation of several systems to obtain and process parametric avatars from different types of inputs.

- Avatar from video: development of a pipeline to obtain an SMPL parametric avatar that fits a target point cloud obtained from a video by using: structure from motion, 3D post-processing and non-linear optimization of the avatar’s pose and shape parameters.
- Avatar from measurements: development of a system to obtain an SMPL parametric avatar with a 3D body that matches a set of target measurement values.
- Implementation of the required tools to aid with the development, testing, analysis and research of the avatars’ technology.
